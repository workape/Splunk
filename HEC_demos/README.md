# HEC
HTTP Event Collector is an amazing tool for getting data into Splunk but not many people are familiar with it.
And with the proliferation of appdev's being able to programmatically send data/logs within code w/REST calls,
it is important to understand it.

Note:  All code here uses requests and json python modules.  You should get both and get them installed, they
are good.
